# CS250
I think this all starts with requirement gathering. I think great requirement gathering from the customer sets the stage for being able to really understand what the customer needs. Once you have a clear understanding of the needs, you can then move to planning how to implement them within the program. User Stories are a good way to go about this because you begin to highlight what the expected behavior is for the scenario, which will allow the developers to be able to create a quality program the first time around. I think the overall idea of Scrum is a great way to go about developing programs and software. I think that it is highly efficient and allow for great flexibility. I personally love Sprints and I am definitely looking to imlement this in future projects. I think the definition of a good team memeber in software development is to first, know you job the best you can. This will help because your team members will be able to rely on you to do what you need to do. Secondly, you should know a bit about what your teammates do so that you can ask the proper clarifying questions in order better help the team goal.
